# Etch-a-Sketch
>
> Mouse over the sketch pad to progressively make each grid square darker until they turn completely black. Sort of works like an Etch-a-Sketch. The main challenge as well as the optional challenges have been completed.

## Things Learned:
- How to manipulate CSS with JavaScript
- How to create and remove a large amount of nodes appended to a parent node.
- How to manipulate node lists.

## Things to Improve:
- The page loads and sometimes reacts slowly. Especially when creating/updating a large amount of grids.
- Could add options to enable the user to select between the modes created when completing the main and optional challenges.
